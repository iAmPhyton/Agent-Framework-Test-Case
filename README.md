Agent Framework Test Case

This project showcases an intelligent agent workflow designed to generate questions and answers on a specific topic. The system incorporates three key agents, each with a distinct role.

Agents

1. Researcher Agent
-   Responsibility: Develop ideas for teaching someone new to the subject.
-   Implementation: Tokenize the input content and generate ideas for teaching.

2. Writer Agent
- Responsibility: Use the Researcherâ€™s ideas to write a piece of text to explain the topic.
- Implementation: Utilize a language model (e.g., BART) to generate teaching text based on the provided ideas.

3. Examiner Agent
- Responsibility: Craft 2-3 test questions to evaluate understanding of the created text, along with the correct answers.
- Implementation: Create test questions based on the generated teaching text.
